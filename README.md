- Using footage shot by you on a smartphone, create a video self-portrait that connects a series of places, objects, events, and people â€” and thus the ideas and meanings that they represent â€” through simple editing techniques. The portrait can either be reflective, and offer a snapshot of your personality, interests, and feelings as you enter into the program, or aspirational, and seek to paint a picture of who you hope to be in a few years time. In either case, you are limited to the following editing techniques:

- Fade to black/white. Cut. Crossfade/dissolve. Adjustment of audio levels and equalisation. Fade audio in/out.</p>

- Create a suite of nine unified and responsive graphic icons in a flat design style, arranged on a simple HTML5 webpage. Each icon must provide some audiovisual feedback in the form of an image swap, and a distinct, thematically appropriate sound effect when the user either hovers their mouse over, or clicks on, each icon. You must choose one of the following concepts to prompt the subject and aesthetics of your suite of icons: I have chosen Growth</p>

- Design and produce a navigable 3D digital environment that is based on some kind of meaningful change or a transformational experience that you have undergone. This could be in relation to a place, an event, an object, a person or group of people, or a relationship between these things.

- You should design the formal elements of this environment (its layout, the scale and arrangement of 3D models, the colour palette, sound design, and the quality and character of each) to evolve throughout the navigational journey in order to describe/reflect your personal experience of change or transformation.</p>

- Produce a single, scrolling webpage, that collects and reflects upon the work that you have produced throughout the semester. A key focus of this webpage should be articulating your journey across the semester as a creative practitioner, with developmental work and the final projects serving as examples and evidence of how your practice has developed over the twelve weeks. This single webpage should include a statement that articulates how you plan to specialise in a particular discipline across the rest of the program. 

- This webpage should be interspersed with reflective writing, in which you critically analyse, evaluate, and contextualise your work, and demonstrate your mastery of the various design languages, techniques, and processes used throughout the course. The formatting and style of the webpage is completely up to you, but should be used as an opportunity to distinguish yourself as an artist or designer, including your interests, tastes, and personality.</p>
