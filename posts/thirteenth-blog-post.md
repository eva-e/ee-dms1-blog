<!-- 1. In a blog post, answer the self reflection questions from the lecture in as much detail as you can. 

2. Consider which pieces of process documentation and reflection will best communicate your personal, technical, and conceptual progress across the semester so far. 

3. Begin to plan out the overall structure of your webpage, and consider how you will distribute this information across a timeline of the semester. Summarise this thought process in a blog post, and include responses to the following questions:

     - What kind of key words do you want the user to associate with the aesthetics of your webpage?
     - Who is the target audience?
     - What features will your audience want to see in your final webpage design?

4. Write a first draft of an artist statement for each of your projects: some useful tips for doing so can be found hereLinks to an external site..  -->
